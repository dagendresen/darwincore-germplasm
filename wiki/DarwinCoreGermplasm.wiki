= Darwin Core Germplasm Extension (DwC-G) =

Development of the Darwin Core Germplasm Extension was started during the Darwin Core workshop in January 2009 (in Copenhagen). This Germplasm Extension is modelled directly from the Multi-Crop Passport  standard and the (proposed) EPGRIS3 trait data standard for characterisation and evaluation data (C&E). The purpose of building this germplasm extension for Darwin Core is for the development of an application schema for the GBIF IPT data publishing toolkit. The DwC Germplasm extension could also stimulate a process of further improved compatibility of the terms for documentation of germplasm and the terms and concepts used for documentation in other sub-domains of biodiversity informatics.

= DwC-G Version 0.1 =

The first version of the Darwin Core Germplasm Extension is 0.1, released on August 26, 2009. This first version follows closely the Multi Crop Passport Descriptor (MCPD) standard. The primary purpose to establish this extension for germplasm to the Darwin Core was as base for the application schema for the GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT).
