= Location Of Safety Duplication =

Most genebank germplasm samples are safe duplicated at least at a second genebank as a black box agreement. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault offer a third safe duplication location. Samples deposited at Svalbard should first be stored at two distinct locations, with Svalbard as the third location.
