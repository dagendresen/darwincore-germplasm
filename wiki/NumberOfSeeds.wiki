The accession number (or estimate number) of seeds

Estimating the number of viable (living) seeds can imply to carry out viability tests (i.e. tetrazolium http://www.kew.org/science/directory/projects/DVG_ViabilityStains.html), or germination tests or seed moisture content tests. Therefore an extra dictionary would be needed.

Also it is important to distinguish between a viability test and one that tests for potential viability. A viability test = a germination or tetrazolium (TZ) test; the latter will only be a true test of viability if dormancy is removed (in the case of a germination test) or the stain is properly taken up (in the case of a TZ test). Something like a cut test or an X-ray test only checks where there are filled seeds present. These filled seeds might be either alive or dead. Therefore cut or X-ray tests do not check for viability as such.

Therefore there will only be one cut or X-ray test per seed lot. There could be many germination tests (= viability tests) per seed lot.

Here again I would like to redirect you to the fields used by ENSCONET for recording those experiences in assessing the viability of an accession. Please see page 27 of http://www.ensconet.eu/PDF/ENSCONET_N4%20manual-April%202009-%20english.pdf
