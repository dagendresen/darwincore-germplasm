Proposed by Stephane Riviere of the ENSCONET - for information on conservation traits: http://www.ensconet.eu/

Threatened taxon category (i.e. IUCN category such as NT, VU, EN, CR, EW) in each bio-geographical region where the taxon occurs (for example in Europe a taxon can be threatened in the Atlantic region but not in the Mediterranean region). Of course these status will evolve as time goes by so it will be useful to take into consideration ALL versions of local red lists or lists of global threatened taxa (ie 2009 BGCI European Threatened List or 1992 Habitat Directive List with 2004 and 2007 amendments)

If DwC Germplasm only wants to focus on a global level, then it could use something close to what BGCI did through its Plant Search tool and diplay for example the 2006 and 1997 IUCN Red Lists categories. For example, if looking for "Betula halophila":

http://www.bgci.org/plant_search.php?action=Find&ftrGenus=Betula&ftrRedList=&ftrSpecies=halophila&ftrRedList1997=&ftrEpithet=&ftrCWR=&x=0&y=0

However a taxon status might be different from one bioregion to the other and this cold be worth recording. In that case if DwC Germplasm wants to consider the bioregion level, there should be some authorities from TDWG (or hired by TDWG) specialist of a bioregion who have to assign scores to threatened taxa occuring in this bioregion.

This was the kind of work carried on by the FP6 ENSCONET project (http://www.ensconet.eu).

Furthermore, ENSCONET distinguished 2 kinds of criteria for Threatened European Native Taxa - please visit http://enscobase.maich.gr/search_conservation.tml
