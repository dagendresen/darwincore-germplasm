EPGRIS3: EXPERIMENT\_NUMBER

An identifier for a Germplasm Trait Experiment (trait measurement experiment, generally with a unique year and location). In the absence of a persistent global unique identifier, you are recommended to construct one from a combination of identifiers in the record that will most closely make the GermplasmExperimentID globally unique.
