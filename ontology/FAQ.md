## What is the Germplasm Ontology?
The Germplasm Ontology provides a vocabulary for publishing and linking a wide range of germplasm-related data on the Web. Germplasm Ontology data can be published by anyone as part of a web site or an API and linked with existing data, therefore creating a germplasm-related web of data.

## Why use the Germplasm Ontology?
The Germplasm Ontology provides a useful framework for:
* Building a germplasm-based website that's also an API.
* Opening up germplasm-related data whilst ensuring it can be used alongside other sources.
* Integrating germplasm-related data across multiple sources.
* Designing a germplasm-related database schema or domain model.

# What technologies is it using?
The Germplasm Ontology is built on RDF, a technology developed by the W3C. RDF enables data to be described as "triples": subject, predicate and object, i.e. "this germplasm" "is part of" "this collection". RDF can be serialized in a number of ways, as shown in our examples. The Germplasm Ontology is specified using OWL, which provides a set of constructs to describe domain models in RDF.
