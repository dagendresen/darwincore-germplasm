      dc:description """The main objective of the Germplasm Ontology is to digitize and provide persistent identifiers for the terms contained within the PGR Descriptors publications. These terms are widely used within the community of plant genetic resources, however there's a lack of clarity on how one should use them to annotate their data, which is often stored in various types of formats. By providing persistent resolvable identifiers in the form of HTTP URIs for each of these terms, alongside many examples, the Germplasm Ontology allows users to annotate their data in ways recognized by the entire community, so that they can be more easily analyzed and discovered.""" ;
